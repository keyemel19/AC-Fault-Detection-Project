# AC-Fault-Detection-Project

## Overview

This project implements an 
AC Fault Detection Sytem. The project includes speed control, voltage and current measurement, power calculation, and user interaction through buttons and an LCD display.

## Features

- **Fault Detection**: Detect faults in power lines using voltage and current measurements.
- **Alert Mechanism**: Alert the operator with a buzzer or light when a fault is detected.
- **Relay Control**: Open a relay to isolate the faulty phase.
- **TDR Integration**: Use a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) to locate the fault.
- **Speed Control**: Control the speed using a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD).
- **Power Calculation**: Calculate and display RMS power, voltage, and current measurements on an LCD.
- **User Interaction**: Adjust settings and control operations using buttons.
## Getting Started
