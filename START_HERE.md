# AC Fault Detection Project


 ### Project Scope
 In this project, we will create a simple AC circuit to simulate U.S. power lines. The circuit will use voltage and current sensors to detect faults. When a fault is detected, the system will alert an operator with a buzzer or light and open a relay to isolate the faulty phase. This allows a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) to locate the fault.

This simulation is important because it reflects in the real-world issues like fire risks, power loss, reduced efficiency, and financial impacts on electrical companies. Additionally, we may include a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) to ensure consistent AC power and an LCD display to show RMS power, voltage, and current measurements.
